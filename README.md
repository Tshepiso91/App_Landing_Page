App Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for an App Landing Page, which is designed to showcase a mobile application and encourage users to learn more about it and download it. The page is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.3.0, and it features a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for various devices.

Features

Jumbotron Section: The landing page begins with a visually appealing jumbotron section that includes a logo and a headline. The content in this section is centered both vertically and horizontally, providing an attractive introduction to the app.

Featured Content: The featured content section is designed to provide a brief description of the app's key features and benefits. The text is centered within the container, making it visually pleasing and easy to read.

Call-to-Action Buttons: The landing page includes two call-to-action buttons that encourage users to take specific actions, such as learning more about the app or downloading it. These buttons are styled using Bootstrap's default button styles.

Trial Section: The trial section showcases app store badges, providing users with a direct link to download the app from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. The badges are displayed side by side, aligned to the center of the container.

Footer: At the bottom of the page, a simple footer displays the copyright information of the app developer (Develop with Tshepiso).
